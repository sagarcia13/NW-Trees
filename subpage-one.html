					<p>There are nearly 150 species of maples worldwide.  Most are from eastern Asia.  North America is home to about a dozen.  Maples are popular ornamental trees and there are many cultivated varieties.  We have three native maple species in the Pacific Northwest:  Big-Leaf Maple and two more shrubby cousins, Vine Maple, Acer circinatum, and Douglas Maple, Acer glabrum.
					<div>Like all maples, the leaves are arranged opposite each other on the stem.  Vine maple leaves have a very distinctive shape.  Its symmetric, palmate leaves have 7-9 regularly spaced lobes, all nearly the same length.  Young stems are a pale green. </div>
