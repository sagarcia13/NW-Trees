During spring and summer, the light green leaves of the tall trees often indicate a source of water in the deserts the Great Basin or Modoc Plateau.

		<p>The tree, a member of the Salicaceae (willow family). The bark is rough and dark-colored, thus “black cottonwood”. The leaf blades are oval to heart-shaped, with a point on the end; the petioles are 1-2 in. long; look for the pair of glands where the petiole joins the blade. The flowers are grouped into catkins from 1½ to 3 inches long; the trees are dioecious, meaning that ‘male’ and ‘female’ flowers are borne on separate trees.</p>
		<p class="sub-page-body">Although the flowers are inconspicuous,this species is well known for its fuzzy fruits, which during spring and early summer float down from the trees, creating the appearance of a light warm-season snowfall. They inhabit riparian areas, especially along streams.</p>
		<p class="sub-page-body">The Spanish name for cottonwoods is “álamo,” leading the conclusion that the proper Spanish name for this tree is “álamo negro.” This name has lent itself to some famous places in America, such as the Alamo in San Antonio, site of a famous battle for Texan independence, as well as Los Alamos, New Mexico, site of American nuclear laboratories. The name of another New Mexican town, Alamogordo, means “the fat cottonwood tree.”</p>
