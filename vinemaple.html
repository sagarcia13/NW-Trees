			<span class="body-bold">DESCRIPTION:</span>“Vine” Maple, although not really a vine, has very slender, often sprawling, branches. These branches often root to produce new trees, creating dense thickets underneath the shade of taller conifers.  It is a small, usually multi-stemmed tree or shrub.

		<p>There are nearly 150 species of maples worldwide.  Most are from eastern Asia.  North America is home to about a dozen.  Maples are popular ornamental trees and there are many cultivated varieties.  We have three native maple species in the Pacific Northwest:  Big-Leaf Maple and two more shrubby cousins, Vine Maple, Acer circinatum, and Douglas Maple, Acer glabrum.</p>
		<p class="sub-page-body">Like all maples, the leaves are arranged opposite each other on the stem.  Vine maple leaves have a very distinctive shape.  Its symmetric, palmate leaves have 7-9 regularly spaced lobes, all nearly the same length.  Young stems are a pale green.</p>
		<p class="sub-page-body">Vine Maple is one of the most popular native shrubs for landscapes.  An enchanting woodland landscape may be created by planting large groupings under the shade of taller trees along with ferns and woodland flowers.  Vine Maple is also a good choice next to buildings and in parking lots.  There is some variability in the fall color display.  Those growing in shade tend to turn a pale yellow; those growing in sun are more likely to turn orange or scarlet.</p>
